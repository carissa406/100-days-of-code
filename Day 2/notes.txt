#you can put _ in a float to make a large number more readable 730000.82 == 730_000.82
#the exponent operator is ** : 43**2
#the round function: round(2.6666, 2) will round the number to 2 decimal places
#use floor division to chop off the decimal parts 8 // 3 = 2 
#all division in python results in a float, even if between two integers

#F-String, so you don't have to convert to strings and have a bunch of +'s
#days = (90 - int(age)) * 365
#weeks = (90 - int(age)) * 52
#months = (90 - int(age)) * 12
#print(f"You have {days} days, {weeks} weeks, and {months} + months left.")
