create empty dictionary
my_dictionary = {}

make a dictionary with keys and values already known
fruits = {"apple": "red and round", 
"orange": "orange and round"}

add somethng to dictionary
fruits["grapes"] = "purple and many small round shapes"

you can append a dictionary to a list but cant appennd a dictionary to a dictionary

edit item in dictionary
fruits["orange"] = "light yellow and round"

looping through dictionary
for key in fruits:
    print(key)
    print(fruits[key]) #for the value and not just key

listing lists inside a dictionary
travel_log = {
    "France": ["Paris, "Lille", "Dijon"] #the value is a list bc dictonaries can only have 1 value, the 1 value here is the list
}

dictionary in a dictionary
travel_log = {
    "France": {"cities_visited": ["Paris, "Lille", "Dijon"]} #cities visited is now a dictonary inside the dictionary travel_log
}

dictionary in a list
travel_log = [
    {
        "country": "France",
        "cities_visited": ["Paris", "Lille", "Dijon"] #key with list value
        "total_visits": 12
    },
    {
        "country": "Germany",
        "cities_visited": ["Berlin", "Hamburg", "Stuttgart"],
        "total_visits": 5
    }
]

dictionaries are unordered so they have no index and must be indexed using the key name
